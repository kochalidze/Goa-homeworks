						<p>I was 13 years old when I started learning programming. Before that, I was a football player and played quite well, but I got carried away by the field of programming and started studying at the <b>GOA</b> Academy.</p>
						<p><b>GOA</b> teaches programming very well, along with studying, it gives you the chance to get a job at the academy. I also got a job with my own determination and achieved a small success, this gave me more motivation and now I strive for big goalsðŸ’š</p>
